# HI THERE
### This code needs to be cleaned and mostly rewritten.
If you decide to run this in Repl, make sure you run `npm run build` first.

I'm still new at Next.js & React.js, so if you think that this code looks like shit it's because that it is. **I didn't make this to be a template for others**, but it isn't hard to modify and make your own.

The SEO for this website is actually pretty good, just make sure you change the meta tags to your own information.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/discord](http://localhost:3000/api/discord). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/discord.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
